Made for Unity3D this class generates what's called "binaural beats". The binaural beat that a person perceives is the frequency difference between the waves entering the left and right ear.  For example, if the left ear registers a tone at 200 Hz and the right ear registers one at 210 Hz, the binaural beat is 10 Hz â€” the difference between the two frequencies. I've made this class for a meditation App.
